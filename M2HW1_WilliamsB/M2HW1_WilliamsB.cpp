    - Ask user for their name
        - Ask user for the following information (all units in dollars)
            - Starting account balance
            - Amount of deposit
            - Amount of withdrawal

Question 2:
 - Use M2LAB1 program as base
    - General Crates has updated cost per cubic foot is now 0.3
    - Management determined they cannot raise their charge per cubic foot above 0.52
        - Modify the program to match these new conditions

Question 3:
 - You are throwing a pizza party.
    - Each visitor should get three slices of pizza.
        - Ask how many pizzas to order
        - Ask how many slices per pizza
        - Ask how many visitors are coming
            - Calculate and display how many pieces of pizza are left over

Question 4:
 - Write a cheering program.
    - Output this message:
        - "Let's go FTCC"
          "Let's go FTCC"
          "Let's go FTCC"
          "Let's go Trojans"
    - Use the following variables in cout statement:
        - string school, team;
    - For bonus:
        - A. You can't print out any raw strings ["That looks like this"]
        - B. You can only use these string variables:
            - string letsGo, school, team, cheerOne, cheerTwo;
        - C. You must use string concatenation to build strings cheerOne and cheerTwo
            - Ex: [string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
